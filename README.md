## Introduction

The advent of Federated Learning (FL) highlights the practical necessity for the 'right to be forgotten' for all clients, allowing them to request data deletion from the machine learning model's service provider. This necessity has spurred a growing demand for Federated Unlearning (FU). Existing methods employ the influence function to achieve feature unlearning, which is impractical for FL as it necessitates the participation of other clients in the unlearning process.

To address these limitations, to the best of our knowledge, this work namely Ferrari is the first work in feature unlearning within FL settings that does not necessitate participation from all other clients. Extensive experimental results and theoretical analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of Ferrari across various feature unlearning scenarios, including sensitive, backdoor, and biased features.

## Getting started

### Preparation

Before executing the project code, please prepare the Python environment according to the `requirement.txt` file. We set up the environment with `python 3.9.12` and `torch 2.0.0`. 

```python
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

### How to run

**1. Federated Model Training**

- Default ResNet-18 model for image datasets and a fully-connected neural network linear model for tabular datasets.

```python
python fl_training_main.py -gpu -train_mode backdoor -dataset Cifar10 -trigger_label 0 -trigger_size 5 -global_epochs 200 -local_epochs 5 -batch_size 128 -lr 0.0001  -client_num 10 -frac 0.4 -momentum 0.5 -optimizer 'sgd' -seed 0 -report_training -save_model 
```

- Fine-tune hyperparameters make sure model achieves convergence during training

**2. Federated Feature Unlearning and Evaluation**

```python
python unlearn_main.py -gpu -unlearning_scenario backdoor -dataset Cifar10 -trigger_label 0 -trigger_size 5 -sample_number 20 -min_sigma 0.05 -max_sigma 1.0 -lr 0.00001 -client_num 10 -batch_size 128 -seed 0 -save_model 
```

- To achieve optimal feature unlearning results, adjust hyperparameters like `lr` and `batch_size`, as they may vary across different unlearning scenarios and datasets.
